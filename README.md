This website is for a fictional shoe company called Golden Shoe. It is built using React.js and is responsive. I've used feautures such as React hooks, resuable components, and more to create this smooth and user friendly website. Some links are decoys as a database with actual shoe products would be required to display the corresponding pages. I am currently building a backend which will allow users to be created and stored in a database. These details can then be used to log in.
